- Real-time alerts and notifications for violations

### 2. **Multi-Source Dashboard**
- Monitor multiple camera feeds simultaneously
- Interactive timeline visualization of violations across all sources
- Real-time compliance metrics and statistics
- Support for both video files and live streams (RTSP, HTTP)

### 3. **PPE Screening Station**
- Pre-entry safety compliance checks
- Live webcam or image upload options

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Webcam (for screening station)
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for better performance)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ppe-violation-detection.git
cd ppe-violation-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the PPE detection model:
   - Place the `ppe.pt` YOLOv5 model file in the `detection/` directory

4. Configure email settings (optional):
   - Update email credentials in `send_mail.py` for alert notifications

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

1. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:5001/`
   - **PPE Screening**: `http://localhost:5001/screening`
   - **Legacy View**: `http://localhost:5001/legacy`

3. Add camera sources from the dashboard or start a screening session

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Flask Web Application** (`app.py`)
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Multi-threaded source processing

2. **Detection Engine** (`detection/ppe_detector.py`)
   - YOLOv5-based object detection
   - Supports multiple PPE classes
   - Configurable confidence thresholds

3. **Frontend Interfaces**
   - Modern dashboard with real-time updates
   - Interactive screening station
   - Responsive design with glass morphism UI

### Threading Model
- Each camera source runs in separate threads:
  - Frame capture thread
  - Detection processing thread
- Background detection runs continuously
- Event queue for real-time distribution

## üì± Features in Detail

### Multi-Source Dashboard

Access at: `http://localhost:5001/`

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time Timeline**: Visual representation of violations across all sources
- **Source Management**: Add/remove video files or live streams
- **Interactive Violations**: Click timeline dots for detailed information
- **Statistics Cards**:
  - Active Sources
  - Active Violations
  - Compliance Rate
  - Last Detection
- **Time Range Selection**: View last 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, or 1 hour
- **Export Capability**: Download detection data as JSON

#### Adding Sources:
1. Click "Add Source"
2. Select type (Video File or Live Stream)
3. Choose file or enter stream URL
4. Optionally name the source
5. Detection starts automatically

### PPE Screening Station

Access at: `http://localhost:5001/screening`

#### Screening Options:

**1. Live Webcam Screening:**
- Real-time PPE detection
- Position guidance for optimal detection
- Auto-completes when all PPE detected

**2. Image Upload:**
- Quick compliance check
- Instant results
- Perfect for pre-arrival verification

#### Required PPE (Configurable):
- Hard Hat (Required)
- Safety Vest (Required)
- Face Mask (Optional)

#### Features:
- Employee ID tracking
- Site-specific requirements
- Screening history logging
- Manager email notifications
- Smooth, real-time video feed

### Detection Capabilities

The system detects the following classes:
- **PPE Items**: Hardhat, Safety Vest, Mask
- **Violations**: NO-Hardhat, NO-Safety Vest, NO-Mask
- **Other**: Person, Safety Cone, machinery, vehicle

#### Violation Types:
- Missing PPE (worker without required equipment)
- Improper wearing (detected but not correctly worn)
- Zone violations (PPE requirements for specific areas)

- Check GPU drivers if using CUDA
- Adjust confidence threshold if needed

**Email alerts not sending:**
- Verify SMTP settings in `send_mail.py`
- Check firewall/network settings
